**Assumptions:**
  
  -   Assume Apple uses a cost of equity, i.e. ùëüùëí , of 5.50 percent and an
after-tax weighted average cost of capital of 9.50 percent, i.e.
ùëüùë§ùëéùëêùëê.
-   The expected return on new investments is 4.00 percent.

  ## Interpretation of the Results
  
  -   Stock price calculated by dividend discount model: \$74.27
-   Stock price calculated by discounted free cash flow model: \$116.24
-   The current stock price: \$131.46

The results show that the stock price calculated using the dividend
discount model and discounted free cash flow model is lower than the
current stock price. This implies that the Apple stock is overvalued
(current price \> calculated prices). Therefore, the current stock price
is not justified by the prospected dividends and free cash flows. In
addition, it is more likely that there will be a correction of the
stock. Based on our calculations, it is recommended that investors
should sell the Apple stock. <br>
  
  ## Differences in Stock Prices and Assumptions
  
  The DDM model is based on the forecast of future dividends payments to
the shareholders. Unfortunately, these forecasts are based on
assumptions and have great uncertainty. Firstly, the model is very
sensitive to the dividend growth rate, which is assumed to stay
constant. Secondly, forecasting the future dividends also means
forecasting future earnings, dividend payout rate and future share
count. Thirdly, the earnings depend on the interest expenses, the payout
rate, on whether the firm repurchases shares or not. Lastly, many of
these are decisions made by the management team which are challenging to
forecast. It is also assumed that the return on new investment does not
change in time.

The DCF model focuses on the total value of the firm to equity and debt
holders by calculating the present value of the prospected free cash
flow. The advantage of the DFC is that we do not need to forecast
dividends, share repurchases, or the use of debt to calculate the value
of a firm. Unfortunately, in the DCF model, the free cash flow forecast
also depends greatly on the growth rate. It is assumed that the growth
rate stays constant for the first five years and then change to a
constant long-term growth rate for the following years. Note that the
free cash flow will be paid to debt and equity holders, so the weighted
average cost of capital has to be used.

As aforementioned, the price returned by my models is significantly
lower than the actual stock price. This is because the models only
include a certain number of factors. Investors are also able to evaluate
a stock by non-financial measures. Such can be the reputation of a firm,
the quality of their management team, prospected R&D successes and much
more. Many positive factors can raise the stock price and hence differ
from the model calculations. Especially Apple is has a decent reputation
and is known for its successes in the past. Hence, many investors are
still willing to buy an overvalued stock at a premium.
